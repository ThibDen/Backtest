# Backtest_V0
Backtest your portfolio. Very rough first version. Some comments in the code to make it understable. Probably still some bugs when you push the limits of the code so be carefull with results. Hope to rewrite it a bit better in the future, all suggestions are welcome.

# Backtest_factor_loadings_V0
Backtest your portfolio based on factor loadings. Very rough first version. Some comments in the code to make it understable. Probably still some bugs when you add different markets so be carefull with results. Hope to rewrite it a bit better in the future, all suggestions are welcome. Inflation correction only works for when you are considering US only portfolios. If you also add non-US market, inflation is ignored.
